Create and test a Graph class based on the specifications below.  The Graph class should create a directed weighted graph using an adjacency list representation.  Assume that the weights are positive integers.
The Graph class should  implement the following constructor and graph algorithms following specifications below. 

Graph constructor
• printGraph method
• Depth first search traversal method
• dijkstraShortestPaths method that implements Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding shortest (cheapest) paths
